## 📊 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy   | Churn Recall |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Logistic Regression | 81.5%      | 18%          |
| Random Forest       | 86.4%      | 47%          |
| Gradient Boosting   | **86.55%** | **47%**      |

Gradient Boosting provided the best balance between precision and recall and was selected as the final model.
